We will start our NLP tutorial with NLP definition and a brief introduction. Then, we will move towards components, libraries, and benefits of natural processing language. Also, we will discuss Natural Language Processing Applications, NLP examples, and tools. \n",

    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing, or NLP, is an area of computer science that focuses on developing techniques to produce machine-driven analyses of text.\n",
    "Why is Natural Language Processing Important?\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP expands the sheer amount of data that can be used for insight. Since so much of the data we have available is in the form of text, this is extremely important to data science!\n",
    "\n",
    "A specific common application of NLP is each time you use a language conversion tool. The techniques used to accurately convert text from one language to another very much falls under the umbrella of \"natural language processing.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why is NLP a \"hard\" problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "Language is inherently ambiguous. Once person's interpretation of a sentence may very well differ from another person's interpretation. Because of this inability to consistently be clear, it's hard to have an NLP technique that works perfectly. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# What Can Developers Use NLP Algorithms For?\n",
    "\n",
    "NLP algorithms are typically based on machine learning algorithms. Instead of hand-coding large sets of rules, NLP can rely on machine learning to automatically learn these rules by analyzing a set of examples (i.e. a large corpus, like a book, down to a collection of sentences), and making a statical inference. In general, the more data analyzed, the more accurate the model will be.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Summarize blocks of text using Summarizer to extract the most important and central ideas while ignoring irrelevant information. \n",
    "    Create a chat bot using Parsey McParseface, a language parsing deep learning model made by Google that uses Point-of-Speech tagging.\n",
    "    Automatically generate keyword tags from content using AutoTag, which leverages LDA, a technique that discovers topics contained within a body of text.\n",
    "    Identify the type of entity extracted, such as it being a person, place, or organization using Named Entity Recognition.\n",
    "    Use Sentiment Analysis to identify the sentiment of a string of text, from very negative to neutral to very positive.\n",

    "Lexical analysis deals with identifying and analyzing word structure. We divide the whole chunk of text into paragraphs, sentences, and words.\n",
    "b. Syntactic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Also called parsing, it involves analyzing words in sentences for grammar and rearranging them to determine how they relate to each other. It rejects sentences like “The apple eats the girl”.\n",
    "c. Semantic Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This deals with extracting the dictionary meanings from text. It also maps syntactic structures and objects in the task domain to check for meaningfulness. It rejects statements like “tall stub”.\n",
    "d. Discourse Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "It analyzes the previous sentence to guess the meaning of the current sentence and the one after it.\n",
    "e. Pragmatic Analysis\n",
